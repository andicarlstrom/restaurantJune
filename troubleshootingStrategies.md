## TROUBLESHOOTING STRATEGIES

1. Think through what you're trying to build. What is the goal? What do I need for an MVP? Make notes, write it down and ask others to provide feedback before building. 
2. Start at the end by building the functions and tools that your main objective is going to use. Then take those elements and plug them into the main objective. 
3. If you get stuck, STOP what you're doing and READ your code. This can be MASSIVELY clarifying.
4. Check your console and FOCUS on the error message. 
5. Google it! 
6. Comment out code to narrow down the problem. 
7. Once you've got something working, THEN try DRYing up your code. Remember, your job isn't to get it right the first time but to get it working.
